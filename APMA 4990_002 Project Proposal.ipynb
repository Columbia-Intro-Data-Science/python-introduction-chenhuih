    "## Motivation and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: #black; font-family: futura; font-size: 1em;\">\n",
    "The idea of using the chart with candlesticks (or candles) for predicting market prices is very old. Two centuries ago, Japanese rice trader found that the candlesticks pattern chart could be used as a tool to predict future prices in a free market with a natural demand-supply balance. The method was improved later by others and today it is successfully used by many traders and investors in the stock market.\n",

    "### What is candlestick chart?\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: #black; font-family: futura; font-size: 1em;\">\n",
    "A candlestick is presented using high, low, opening, and closing prices during a certain trading period, for example, trading day. A regular candlestick figure consists of Real Body, Upper Shadow, and Lower Shadow. The number of candlesticks that is normally used for predicting can range within 1..12. Evidently, the number of different combinations of several candlesticks in a row can be big. \n",

    "#### 1. Three Line Strike\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: #black; font-family: futura; font-size: 1em;\">\n",
    "The bullish three line strike reversal pattern carves out three black candles within a downtrend. Each bar posts a lower low and closes near the intrabar low. The fourth bar opens even lower but reverses in a wide-range outside bar that closes above the high of the first candle in the series. The opening print also marks the low of the fourth bar. According to Bulkowski, this reversal predicts higher prices with an 84% accuracy rate.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2. Evening Stars\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: #black; font-family: futura; font-size: 1em;\">\n",
    "The bearish evening star reversal pattern starts with a tall white bar that carries an uptrend to a new high. The market gaps higher on the next bar but fresh buyers fail to appear, yielding a narrow range candlestick. A gap down on the third bar completes the pattern, which predicts the decline will continue to even lower lows, perhaps triggering a broader scale downtrend. According to Bulkowski, this pattern predicts lower prices with a 72% accuracy rate.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 3. Abandoned Baby\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: #black; font-family: futura; font-size: 1em;\">\n",
    "The bullish abandoned baby reversal pattern appears at the low of a downtrend, after a series of black candles print lower lows. The market gaps lower on the next bar but fresh sellers fail to appear, yielding a narrow range doji candlestick with opening and closing prints at the same price. A bullish gap on the third bar completes the pattern, which predicts the recovery will continue to even higher highs, perhaps triggering a broader scale uptrend. According to Bulkowski, this pattern predicts higher prices with a 70% accuracy rate.\n",

    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: #black; font-family: futura; font-size: 1em;\">\n",
    "Our project goal is to design and implement a equity market candlestick pattern recognition web app based on the previous equity market stock price data. Our portal will aid users to make desicions if they should buy or sell particular stock, by giving them the likelihood whether a stock price will rise/fall. Generally, we have two goals. Firstly, we need to use classification method to identify some typical Candlestick patterns like: \"abandoned baby\", \"Evening star\" from the price trends of different stocks. Identifying these trends is the prerequisite of making predictions.Secondly, we hope this app can achieve the following thing: when a user loads a set of time series data of the prices of a particular stock, the app can analyze the price trend of this stock and compare it with the similar trends in the whole dataset, which consists of the price data of all the stocks exist in the stock market, from 01/01/2015 to 01/01/2017, for example. In order to achieve our goals, we plan to utilize supervised classification method for the first goal and implement a backpropagation neuron network model to make predictions on stock price trend, which means the price of a particular stock will rise or fall in a short term.\n",

    "### Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use daily candlechart data from [finance.yahoo.com](http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EIXIC/history?p=%5EIXIC), which is presented in the standard OHLC (open, high, low, close) format along with the trading volume.\n",

    "<span style=\"color: #black; font-family: futura; font-size: 1em;\">\n",
    "ANN is a field of computational science with various types of methods which tries to solve real world problems by offering strong solutions [1]. Generally, ANN is a multi-layer network which includes input layer, hidden layer and output layer shown in Fig. 4. It mirrors the basic characteristic of a human brain, and has the ability of human to learn and generate its own knowledge from its surroundings [2].\n",
    "According to Kamijo and Tanigawa’s [4] research on the ANN algorithm, they had found that the ANN algorithm is able to identify and recognise candlestick patterns in the learning and training stage. Other experiment works by Naeni, Taremia and Hashemi [3], Charkha [5], Kardos and Cwiok [6] which have shown significant results through implementing the ANN algorithm for prediction, whereby the ANN algorithm is more consistent in recognising the patterns.\n",

    "SVM is a supervised learning model which can act upon analysing data and recognising patterns. In SVM, a hyperplane is used for classification and regression in separating the data to the nearest training data point, which is based on the categories provided by the SVM training algorithm [7]. Basically, SVM utilises a set of input data to build a model in dividing the data into distinctly defined categories [8].\n",
